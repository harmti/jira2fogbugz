### JIRA to FogBugz importer

**code is very unstable**

A simple script that goes through all JIRA issues and creates cases in FogBugz.

At the moment it is quite unstable, as I customized the script to work for my needs.
There is a lot of things that I would need to add, to make it a complete JIRA to FogBugz importer.

But if anyone is interested feel free and fork away.
