# JIRA to FogBugz importer

**code is rather experimental**

A simple script that goes through all JIRA issues and creates cases in FogBugz.

At the moment this is experimental, customized to work for my needs.

Supports case type, priority, attachments and comments. It has been used to import one Jira project to FogBugz pretty successfully. Should only be used to import complete projects.

Would need more work to make it a complete JIRA to FogBugz importer. But if anyone is interested, please feel free and fork away.
